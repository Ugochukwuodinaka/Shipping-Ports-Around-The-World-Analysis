## Project Overview

### Introduction:
The question has changed over time as maritime operations have improved and stakeholders’ needs have altered. Today, a seaport serves different functions than what it did for several decades. Seismic changes, such as the growth of China as a manufacturing giant, have substantially changed the industry. But the biggest difference is the role that seaports now play in the wider global economy. Time was that a seaport would simply be a place to unload or load goods from a vessel. Today, seaports are central to any manufacturer’s supply chain plan and are ranked based on several aspects. These could be the amount of automation equipment they possess, the skill of their workforce, its access to key markets, and the depth of its berth.
Increasingly, data and the ability of a seaport to process and share it among stakeholders is what supply chain companies are looking for. This then raises a further set of questions, such as ‘What is a smart port?’ Although frequently located on a seacoast or estuary, some ports can be situated miles inland, with access to the sea via river or canal. If a port is located on a lake, river, or canal that goes to a sea or ocean, that port can be defined as an inland port. Ports can also be called a harbor.

The "Shipping Ports Around The World Analysis" project aims to provide insights into the global shipping industry by analyzing data related to shipping ports worldwide. The project will involve gathering, processing, and analyzing data pertaining to various aspects of shipping ports, including port country, traffic volume, port name, port types, UN Code, vessels volume in ports, geographical distribution, and operational efficiency. 


### Objectives:
The raw data has some issues, so we'll need to make the following adjustments and assumptions to clean and prep the data:
- Let’s stick to trips that were NOT sent via “store and forward”
- I’m only interested in street-hailed trips paid by card or cash, with a standard rate
