## Project Overview

### Introduction:
The question has changed over time as maritime operations have improved and stakeholders’ needs have altered. Today, a seaport serves different functions than what it did for several decades. Seismic changes, such as the growth of China as a manufacturing giant, have substantially changed the industry. But the biggest difference is the role that seaports now play in the wider global economy. Time was that a seaport would simply be a place to unload or load goods from a vessel. Today, seaports are central to any manufacturer’s supply chain plan and are ranked based on several aspects. These could be the amount of automation equipment they possess, the skill of their workforce, its access to key markets, and the depth of its berth.
Increasingly, data and the ability of a seaport to process and share it among stakeholders is what supply chain companies are looking for. This then raises a further set of questions, such as ‘What is a smart port?’ Although frequently located on a seacoast or estuary, some ports can be situated miles inland, with access to the sea via river or canal. If a port is located on a lake, river, or canal that goes to a sea or ocean, that port can be defined as an inland port. Ports can also be called a harbor.

The "Shipping Ports Around The World Analysis" project aims to provide insights into the global shipping industry by analyzing data related to shipping ports worldwide. The project will involve gathering, processing, and analyzing data pertaining to various aspects of shipping ports, including port country, traffic volume, port name, port types, UN Code, vessels volume in ports, geographical distribution, and operational efficiency. 


### Objectives:
- Determine the total number of ports worldwide categorized by type to provide an overview of global port infrastructure.
- Identify the top 10 ports with the highest number of vessels in traffic to pinpoint major maritime hubs and assess their significance in global shipping networks.
- Determine the top 10 countries with the most number of ports to understand regional variations in port infrastructure and maritime connectivity.
- Identify the top 10 ports with the most expected arrival vessels to understand the busiest ports in terms of incoming maritime traffic.
- Determine the top 10 ports with the most traffic by area globally to gain insights into the spatial distribution and magnitude of maritime activities on a global scale.
- Identify the top 10 ports with the most traffic by area locally to understand regional variations in port activity and traffic distribution.
- Examine the trends of the top 20 ports over time, including vessels in port, vessels departed, and vessels arrived, to identify patterns, fluctuations, and growth trajectories in maritime activities.
- Create a geospatial map illustrating the locations of ports across continents to visualize the global distribution of port infrastructure and its relationship with geographical features.


### Deliverables:
- I will render a summary of the total number of ports worldwide by type, providing insights into the composition and distribution of global port infrastructure.
- Will list of the top 10 ports by vessels in traffic, along with relevant statistics and analysis highlighting their importance in global maritime transportation.
- Will identify the top 10 countries with the most number of ports, accompanied by analysis showing regional disparities and maritime connectivity.
- Will render a compilation of the top 10 ports with the most expected arrival vessels, offering insights into the busiest ports in terms of incoming maritime traffic.
- Will analyze the top 10 ports with the most traffic by area globally, providing insights into spatial distribution and magnitude of maritime activities.
- Will analyze the top 10 ports with the most traffic by area locally, offering insights into regional variations in port activity and traffic distribution.
- Will create an analysis of traffic trends for the top 20 ports, presenting visualizations and interpretations of vessels in port, vessels departed, and vessels arrived over time to discern patterns and growth trajectories.
- Will generate an interactive map showcasing the locations of ports across continents, providing a visual representation of global port infrastructure and its spatial distribution.


### Dataset Overview
This dataset containing useful data of 450+ ports around the world. The dataset comprises of vital information crucial for a deep insight into the locations and operations of shipping ports around the world. It includes fields such as Serial_No, Country, Port Name, UN Code, Vessels in Port, Departures(Last 24 Hours), Arrivals(Last 24 Hours), Expected Arrivals, Type, Area Local, Area Global, and Also known as. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncoverports type, location, arrival and departure traffic volume, and more.

This dataset is a CSV file made up of a single table named Ports_Data and was provided by [Quantum Analytics](https://www.quantumanalyticsco.org/). You can click on this [link](Shipping-Ports-Around-The-World-Analysis/blob/main/Port_Data.csv) to preview the raw data file. This dataset table is made up of 12 fields and 480 rows of ports data.

Below are some information on the fields we have in this dataset for a better understanding of this analysis:
- __Serial_No:__ This field represents a unique identifier or serial number assigned to each entry or row in the dataset. It serves as a reference number for tracking and organizing the data.
- __Country:__ This field indicates the country in which the port is located. It provides information about the geographical location or jurisdiction of the port.
- __Port Name:__ This field contains the name or designation of the port. It identifies the specific port within the country and serves as a label for referencing and distinguishing between different ports.
- __UN Code:__ The UN Code is a unique identifier assigned to each port by the United Nations (UN). It provides a standardized code for identifying ports internationally, facilitating communication and data exchange across different systems and organizations.
- __Vessels in Port:__ This field represents the number of vessels currently present at the port. It indicates the level of maritime activity and congestion at the port at a given point in time.
- __Departures (Last 24 Hours):__ This field indicates the number of vessels that have departed from the port within the last 24 hours. It provides information about recent outbound maritime traffic from the port.
- __Arrivals (Last 24 Hours):__ This field indicates the number of vessels that have arrived at the port within the last 24 hours. It provides information about recent inbound maritime traffic to the port.
- __Expected Arrivals:__ This field indicates the number of vessels expected to arrive at the port within a specified time frame, typically within the next few days. It provides advance notice of incoming maritime traffic and helps port authorities and stakeholders plan and manage port operations effectively.
- __Type:__ This field categorizes the port based on its primary function or specialization. Common port types that were provided in this analysis are ports, anchorage nad marina.
- __Area Local:__ This field refer to the local geographical area or region in which the port is situated. It provides additional context about the port's location within its immediate surroundings.
- __Area Global:__ This field refer to the global geographical region or area to which the port belongs. It provides information about the port's broader geographical context and its connection to global maritime networks.
- __Also known as:__ This field contain alternative names or aliases for the port. It provides additional information about how the port may be referred to in different contexts or languages.
